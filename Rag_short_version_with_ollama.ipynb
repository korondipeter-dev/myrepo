        "This notebook provides a complete solution for building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using PDF documents, Ollama for embeddings and response generation, and ChromaDB for vector storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook is structured as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setup and Installation**: Installs necessary libraries and tools, including `fitz` (PyMuPDF) for PDF processing, `ollama` for interacting with the Ollama service, and `chromadb` for the vector database. It also includes commands to set up Ollama itself.\n",
        "2.  **PDF Processing and Embedding**: Defines and uses a function `process_pdf_to_chroma` to:\n",
        "    *   Extract text from PDF files in a specified input directory (`/content/input`).\n",
        "    *   Chunk the extracted text into smaller pieces.\n",
        "    *   Generate embeddings for each chunk using a specified Ollama model (`mxbai-embed-large`).\n",
        "    *   Add the generated embeddings, original text chunks, and unique IDs to a ChromaDB collection (`pdf_embeddings`).\n",
        "3.  **Interactive Question Answering**: Sets up an interactive loop where the user can ask questions. For each query:\n",
        "    *   An embedding is generated for the user's question.\n",
        "    *   Relevant document chunks are retrieved from the ChromaDB collection based on the query embedding.\n",
        "    *   A prompt is constructed combining the user's query and the retrieved context.\n",
        "    *   A response is generated using another Ollama model (`gemma3:4b`) based on the prompt.\n",
        "    *   The generated response is displayed to the user.\n",
        "4.  **Database Management**: Includes a utility function `empty_chroma_db` to clear all data from the ChromaDB collection, allowing for easy resetting of the database.\n",
        "5.  **References**: Provides links to external resources related to RAG concepts and implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use this notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Ensure Ollama is running and the required models (`mxbai-embed-large` and `gemma3:4b`) are pulled.\n",
        "2.  Place your PDF documents in the `/content/input` directory.\n",
        "3.  Run the cells sequentially.\n",
        "4.  Use the interactive loop to ask questions about the content of your PDF files."

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W.

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",

Until recently the great majority of naturalists\\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\\nallusion', 's to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\\nI need not here enter on details.\\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\\n And in like m', 'anner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\\n the formation of the teeth.\\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\\ndid the eminent service of ', 'arousing attention to the probability of all\\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\\nsimple productions, he maintain', 's that such forms are now spontaneously\\ngenerated.[2]\\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\\n arise at', ' about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\\n years 1794-5.\\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\\npa', 'per was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply', ',\\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\\n“horticultural ex'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'embeddings'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]} \n",
